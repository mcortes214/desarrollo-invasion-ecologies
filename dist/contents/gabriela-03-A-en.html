However, the plague of plastic trash, produced by humans, floods seas and oceans. The plastics and other wastes travel to any place where the waves and sea currents take them, trespassing political and geographical borders. </p><p>We have so few sanctuaries on Earth without plastic trash. At some kilometers distance from any big urban zone, in the middle of the sea, we can find plastic waste, even at the deepest sea parts.</p><p>The increasing pace of plastic pollution is alarming. The plastic production doubles each decade and more and more amounts of trash end up in the seasâ€” More than 8 million tons each year is estimated, according to The UN Environmental Program (UNEP). </p><p>Today, the Mediterranean Sea has the most concentration of hydrocarbons and plastic waste of all the seas on the planet. Most of the pollution, which arrives in the waters, results from activities done on land. </p><a class="js-load-content" data-modal-name="modal-gabriela-03-B-en" href="contents/gabriela-03-B-en.html">[ Continue ]</a></div></div></div></div></div></div>
