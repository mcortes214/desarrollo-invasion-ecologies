The transportation of marine species from an ecological niche to a different one, may cause colossal damage to ecosystems, sometimes exterminating entire species or transforming communities completely. </p><p>Historically, the species would introduce themselves in new environments mainly through natural kinds of floating waste like wood, weed beds, among others. Throughout history, we humans move species from a continent to another for productive gain. Nowadays, plastic waste is the perfect recipient to transport all kinds of species, due to its floating capacity and resistance to degradation. </p><p>The Plasticsphere constitutes these new micro and macroscopic ecosystems, which have evolved and conquered these environments made from plastic that was produced by humans. This plastic waste works as a more enduring “ship”, better than other kinds of waste, and has the capacity to transport and spread organisms for longer distances. </p><p>Bacteria, weeds, crabs, viruses, fish larvae, mollusks, arthropodae and bivalves are being introduced into new habitats around the world. When these different aquatic species arrive in strange territories, they may become “invading species” and they are a threat to many species that directly contribute to ecosystems and human beings. </p><img class="u-width-100" src="img/plastisfera-1.jpg"><img class="u-width-100" src="img/plastisfera-2.jpg"><img class="u-width-100" src="img/plastisfera-3.jpg"><img class="u-width-100" src="img/plastisfera-4.jpg"></div></div></div></div></div></div>
