Differently from jellyfish, they don’t have stinging cells in their tentacles. However, their tentacles do have coloblastic cells, which means that when they catch their prey, this cannot escape and gets stuck to the tentacle. </p><p>They have become a problem in these zones due to the speed they reproduce with. </p><p>In 1980 this species was introduced to the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. It is believed to be introduced by the ballast water from the merchant ships. Nowadays, it has been dispersed and now we can find it already in the Mediterranean Sea and it is a big threat to the local sea animals. </p><video class="video-player u-cursor-pointer u-width-100 u-max-height-100 u-object-position-center" src="video/caracoles-3D.mp4" preload="metadata" loop></video><h2>2- <i>Rapana venosa</i></h2><p>The rapana venosa is a great sea snail with a beautiful shell. It belongs to the Asian Pacific  Northwest, from Vladivostok (Russia) to Hong Kong. This gastropod is a member of the Muricidae family and it is notorious for being a successful as an invading organism. </p><p>In 1946, they discovered the species in the Black Sea and, lately, it spread to the Mediterranean Sea. In 1998 it was found in Chesapeake, where it was probably transported by the ballast water. The snail is also established in European coastal waters, from Norway to Spain, and in the estuary of Rio de la Plata in South America. </p><p>The high capacity of the invasion of this snail is added to its trophic habits (they prey on any bivalve) and that becomes a great potential threat to the malacological resources (mollusks) of the sea waters around the world. They cause serious ecological damage and the collapse of the oyster, mussel and clam fisheries with the socio-economic consequences that this implies. </p><video class="video-player u-cursor-pointer u-width-100 u-max-height-100 u-object-position-center" src="video/sealion-3D.mp4" preload="metadata" loop></video><h2>3- <i>Pterois miles</i></h2><p>The lionfish (Pterois miles) is a fish species with striped fins from the Scorpaenidae family. It belongs to the West region of the Indian Pacific. </p><p>They can grow 35cm long. It is known thanks to their numerous dorsal fins which extend across their body. These fins are highly poisonous. Their dorsal fin is similar to a plume with striped feathers. The lionfish is a generalist carnivore and it can feed on a great variety of fish and mollusks. </p><p>They belong to the Indian Ocean, their population spreads from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and towards East Sumatra.  </p><p>A decade later after the intentional or accidental liberation in aquariums of Florida. The lionfish spread completely in the entire Southeast of the United States and the Caribbean Sea, arriving in South America and the great part of the Mexican Gulf. In the Atlantic Ocean, the lionfish is more numerous than in its native region and it became the dominant predator of the coral reefs with a great impact to the native reef fish species. </p><p>In the Mediterranean Sea, the lionfish was just reported occasionally in the East part, but studies show that this species is increasing its numbers making itself a great threat to marine species in this region. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
