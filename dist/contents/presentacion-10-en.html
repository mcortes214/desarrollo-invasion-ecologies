Recently, a group of ecologists signed their protest against the discrimination marshalled under invasive species rhetoric. Entitled ‘Don’t judge species on their origins’, a pun on Charles Darwin’s classic, On the Origin of Species, the 19 scientists claim there is a ‘pervasive bias against alien species’ across science, government, policy-makers, conservationists and the public in which ‘non-native’ species are vilified for driving beloved ‘native’ species to extinction’ or ‘generally polluting “natural” environments’ (Davis et al., 2011: 153). They point out that ‘invasion biology’ gained prominence in the 1990s, often deploying militaristic metaphors and exaggerated crises to ‘convey the message that introduced species are the enemies of man and nature’ (ibid.: 153). While there are indeed instances of introduced species becoming threats to the local environment, they continue, ‘recent analyses suggest that invaders do not represent a major extinction threat to most species in most environments’ and ‘in fact … non-native species have almost always increased the number of species in a region’ (ibid.: 153). <a class="filter-interactive-blur animation-interactive-shake u-display-inline-block" target="_blank" href="https://www.abogacia.es/en/publicaciones/blogs/blog-de-derecho-de-los-animales/cotorra-argentina-y-cotorra-de-kramer-no-todo-vale-para-su-control-poblacional/">They conclude that classifying biota ‘according to their adherence to cultural standards of belonging, citizenship, fair play and morality does not advance our understanding of ecology’</a> (ibid.: 153).
