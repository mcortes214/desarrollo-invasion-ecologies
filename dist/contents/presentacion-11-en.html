Their nest is a sort of complex structure of horizontal dwellings. A globe-shaped structure that interconnects several tunnels. It also has an additive logic: a new nest can be attached to an existing one. </p><p>This is the only species of parrot that builds its nest by gathering and assembling small branches.</p><p>Despite the bad press that the Argentine parrot has received as a result of its rapid dissemination throughout Europe, some positive qualities can be attributed to this friendly bird. In Chile, it has been observed “the use of parrot nests by nine resident species on twenty-two occasions in Santiago. Of these, only the rock pigeon (9.1%) and the house sparrow (27.3%) were non-native, while the rest were all native. Thus, the American kestrel (27.3%), the southern blackbird (9.1%), the common goldcrest (9.1%), the aplomado falcon (4.5%), the rufous-legged owl (4.5%), the Austral thrush (4.5%) and the common turtle dove (4.5%) are native species that use the resource of an invasive species during their reproductive cycle.” <a class="filter-interactive-blur animation-interactive-shake u-display-inline-block" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/11/923/htm">[Briceño, C.; Sandoval-Rodríguez, A.; Yévenes, K.; Larraechea, M.; Morgado, A.; Chappuzeau, C.; Muñoz, V.; Dufflocq, P.; Olivares, F. “Interactions between Invasive Monk Parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) and Other Bird Species during Nesting Seasons in Santiago, Chile”.
