    h1 Ecologies of the Inhuman: The Singing of the Whales

    p If the oceans are a big watery body that doesn't lack life, it means we can get into this intimate body which is far beyond anthropic reason, where “the world also theorizes and experiments with themselves.”
    p ¿How do oceans sound and how will they sound in the future?
    p The sound landscape of the oceans is becoming a shrill cacophony due to the noise generated by human activity. Protecting the whales is important to maintain the oceans healthy for everyone. These animals fertilize the marine ecosystems and they even help us to counteract the climate crisis; in average, throughout their lives, a whale confines the same amount of carbon as the equivalent of 1,000 trees. 
    p The whales inhabit all of the world’s oceans, communicating with each other with complex and mysterious sounds. The health of these sea mammals is weaved and it is then a key indicator of the health of the oceans. 
    p We invite you to immerse into those inhuman ecologies with the singing of the whales and other subaquatic sounds. 
    p With the singing of the whales, this interactive interface invites us to create awareness of the global sound pollution caused by human activity in the oceans and their effects in the marine ecosystems. 
    p By pressing keys “1”, “2”, “3”, “4” and “5”you can play different subaquatic sounds and generate your own subaquatic sound composition.
