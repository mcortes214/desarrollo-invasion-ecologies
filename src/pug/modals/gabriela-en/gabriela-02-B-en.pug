    p Whales find their way through the deep ocean thanks to their singing. They communicate constantly between pairs, they avoid obstacles and detect prey from very long distances with the echo they produce and detect. Some species of the cetacean family, dolphins and porpoises don’t have a hearing as good as developed, but they have the capacity of feeling the vibrations of the sounds underwater in all of their bodies.

    p This communication method is called echolocation and consists in the emission of sounds that go and expand throughout the water until they reach the receptor. In the water, the sounds spread faster and with less energy loss than in the air. The sound and ultrasound are transmitted in the water at a speed between 1400 and 1600 meters per second, while in the atmosphere the spreading speed is 340 meters per second.

    p These great mammals are capable of understanding each other to perfection, finding themselves within a dozen-kilometer distance and even distinguishing the individual they are communicating with by just using their sounds and singing. 
    p Nowadays, the submarine noise interferes and degrades more and more the acoustic sound of the cetaceans, disturbing their communication, life habits and therefore their survival. Owing to different human activities in the oceans the noise levels have been duplicated in each decade for the last 60 years. More than 90% of global commerce is transported in ships where the propeller generates an intense noise.

    p The cetaceans are exposed to a permanent noise in the main commercial routes. The chronic sound causes a stress which affects cetaceans’ health, same with other submarine species and can reduce their successful reproduction. 
    p Another issue is that the whales are being severely threatened during military operations. When warships activate their sonars, the extremely high-frequency sounds spread through dozens or hundreds of miles in all directions to detect submarines and other obstacles. Recent studies show how sonars affect the health and behavior of whales. Not only until the 60’s, the frequency used by ships to detect submarines was 8KHz or higher. However, in recent decades, lower frequency ranges were starting to get used, between 4.5 and 5.5  KHz, which provoked mass beaching of cetaceans around the world.

    p In the same way, the noise caused by seismic exploration, employed in oil and gas detection on the seabed puts cetaceans lives at risk. During these naval explorations, the pneumatic cannons employed, produce an intense noise that pulses every few seconds and they can go for weeks or even months. These pulsing-air detonations are so strong that they can travel thousands of meters in the water and penetrate from dozens to hundreds of kilometers within the Earth crust. The echo bounces in the oil and gas deposits and then returns to the measurement instruments placed on the surface.

    p These dins can cause considerable degradation of the marine environment within wide areas. Without question, the underwater noise pollution is a serious threat to marine life and oceanic health. 
    p Today, there is a great concern between environmentalists about the increase in the noise in the oceans produced by underwater human activities. We humans are ending the silence typical to marine habitat. Because of that, it is fundamental to understand the impacts of acoustic pollution in the oceans and execute urgent policies to mitigate such impacts in the ecosystems and their communities.
