    p “In my view, the #[+partials_first-text-internal-link("presentacion-05-en", "Epistemologies of the South")] are the call for new processes of production, for the valorization of valid knowledge, scientific and non-scientific, and for new links between different kinds of knowledge, based on practices of the social classes and groups that have systematically experienced destruction, oppression and discrimination as a result of capitalism, colonialism and their naturalization of all kinds of inequality – the exchange value, individual ownership of land, the slaughter of Mother Earth, racism, sexism, individualism, the material over the spiritual, and every other monoculture (economic, political and cultural) of the mind and society that attempts to block emancipatory imagination and to sacrifice any alternative. In this sense, these are a set of epistemologies, not just one, that stem from this premise, and from a South that is not geographical, but metaphorical: the #[+partials_first-text-internal-link("presentacion-06-en", "anti-imperial South")].” (Sousa Santos, Boaventura de. “Introducción: las epistemologías del sur”. In CIDOB. #[i Formas-Otras. Saber, nombrar, narrar, hacer]. Barcelona: CIDOB Ediciones, 9-22.).
